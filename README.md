# SmartPromptHub
A smart prompt library to streamline generative AI usage, with a focus on education.

# Prompt Library

## Project Background
I'm a university teacher who frequently uses generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, etc.) to create course outlines, summarize exam keypoints, and more. However, manually typing prompts is repetitive and time-consuming. For example, "Generate a Markdown course outline for thermodynamics" and "Summarize cytology exam keypoints in Markdown" share similar structures, yet I have to retype them every time. To solve this, I want to build a **Prompt Library**—a tool to streamline prompt creation and boost efficiency, with a focus on educational use cases.

## Project Goals
- **Core Goal**: Reduce repetitive prompt typing and improve efficiency when using generative AI.
- **Vision**: A cross-platform, optional-use tool that integrates as a plugin into AI software and leverages AI to optimize prompts.
- **Community-Driven**: I’m seeking help from the GitHub community to make this tool professional and widely useful.

## Core Features
1. **Eliminate Repetition**
   - Predefined templates, e.g., "Generate a {theme} course outline in {format}."
   - Example: Input "thermodynamics" and "Markdown" → "Generate a thermodynamics course outline in Markdown."
2. **Boost Efficiency**
   - Quick template selection and batch processing (e.g., generate outlines for multiple courses at once).
3. **Predictive Prompt Suggestions**
   - Smart suggestions as you type, e.g., typing "Generate a" suggests "course outline" or "summary."

## Future Vision
- Cross-platform support for various AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok).
- Integration as a plugin into tools like ChatGPT, Notion, or VSCode.
- AI-powered prompt optimization, e.g., turning "Write an outline" into "Generate a structured Markdown outline with introduction and goals."
